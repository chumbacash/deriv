# Get Active Symbols

This repository contains a python scripts that connects to the Deriv WebSocket API to retrieve anything within deriv platform. The script demonstrates how to interact with the Deriv API using websockets and process the response to display active symbols this can be later be used in retriving the data so that we can build machine learning and AI models that can trade within the deriv ecosystem.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- `websockets` library
- `json` library (comes built-in with Python)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chumbacash/deriv.git
   cd deriv

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   To do this, this is where to start by typing:

   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\scripts\activate  (windows)

## Way forward:

I will be adding more of deriv scripts follow along to learn more from me. There are alot of opportunities within the deriv markets. Be creative.

Also, remember you are responsible of the code outcomes. I do not take the risk of losing your money in this volatile market of deriv.

Lovely day from Chumbacash
