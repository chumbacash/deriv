# Get Active Symbols

This repository contains a Python script that connects to the Deriv WebSocket API to retrieve anything within deriv platform. The script demonstrates how to interact with the Deriv API using websockets and process the response to display active symbols.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- `websockets` library
- `json` library (comes built-in with Python)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chumbacash/deriv.git
   cd deriv

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   To do this, this is where to start by typing:

   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\scripts\activate  (windows)


## Way forward:

I will be adding more of deriv scripts follow along to learn more from me.

Lovely day from Chumbacash
